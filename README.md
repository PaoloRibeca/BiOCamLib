# BiOCamLib

BiOCamLib is the [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) foundation upon which a number of the bioinformatics tools I developed are built.

It mostly consists of a library &mdash; you will need to clone this repository if you want to manually compile other programs I've developed, notably [SiNPle](https://github.com/PaoloRibeca/SiNPle) or [KPop](https://github.com/PaoloRibeca/KPop). You might also use the library for your own programs, if you are familiar with OCaml and patient enough to read the code.

As a bonus, BiOCamLib comes bundled with a program called `Parallel`, which allows you to split and process an input file chunk-wise using the reader/workers/writer model implemented in `BiOCamLib.Tools.Parallel`. You can see it as a demonstration of the capabilities of the library, but I also often use it as a useful tool to solve real-life problems.

## Installing `Parallel`

There are several possible ways of installing the software on your machine: by downloading pre-compiled binaries (Linux x86_64 only); or manually.

### Pre-compiled binaries 

### Manual install

Alternatively, you can install `Parallel` manually by cloning and compiling its sources. You'll need an up-to-date distribution of the OCaml compiler and the [Dune package manager](https://github.com/ocaml/dune) for that. Both can be installed through [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/), the official OCaml distribution system. Once you have a working OPAM distribution you'll also have a working OCaml compiler, and Dune can be installed with the command
```
$ opam install dune
```
if it is not already present. Make sure that you install OCaml version 4.12 or later.

Then go to the directory into which you have downloaded the latest BiOCamLib sources, and type
```
$ ./BUILD
```

That should generate the executable `Parallel`. Copy it to some favourite location in your PATH, for instance `~/.local/bin`.

## Command line options for `Parallel`

This is the full list of command line options available for the program `Parallel`. You can visualise the list by typing
```bash
$ Parallel -h
```
in your terminal. You will see a header containing information about the version:
```
This is the Parallel program (version 0.4)

```
followed by detailed information. The general form(s) the command can be used is:
```
./Parallel [OPTIONS] -- [COMMAND TO PARALLELIZE AND ITS OPTIONS]
```
